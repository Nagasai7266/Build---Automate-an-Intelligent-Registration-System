# TODO: Build & Automate an Intelligent Registration System

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Create index.html: Main registration form with all required fields (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Age, Gender, Address, Country/State/City dropdowns, Password, Confirm Password, Terms).
- [x] Create styles.css: Responsive styling, error highlighting in red, success/error alerts.
- [x] Create script.js: Client-side validations (required fields, email disposable check, phone country code, password strength meter, disable submit, inline errors, success/error messages).
- [x] Create process.php: Backend simulation to process form data, validate server-side if needed, return success or error JSON.
- [x] Set up package.json for Cypress dependencies.
- [x] Create Cypress test files: Automate form filling, validation checks, submission, and verify success/error messages.
- [ ] Install dependencies (PHP, Node.js, Cypress). (Cypress installing, PHP not installed due to admin requirements)
- [x] Run server locally. (Using Python http.server as alternative)
- [ ] Execute Cypress tests to verify automation. (Pending Cypress installation)
- [ ] Test the form manually in browser.
